# StudentCourseRegisteration
Simple menu driven java project for course registration that uses hashmap and AVL trees to store data.
In a university, the Registrar's Office is responsible for managing student enrollment and course registration. They want to improve their system by using data structures such as HashMap and AVL Tree to efficiently handle the following tasks:

    Student Enrollment: Students enroll in courses each semester. Each student has a unique student ID, and each course has a unique course code. Students can enroll in multiple courses, and courses can have multiple enrolled students.

    Course Registration: Students can add or drop courses during the registration period. The registration system should efficiently allow students to perform these actions.

    Course Roster: The university needs a way to generate a roster for each course, listing all the enrolled students.

    Student Schedule: Each student should be able to view their current schedule, which lists the courses they are enrolled in.

    Conflict Resolution: Ensure that students are not able to enroll in courses with overlapping schedules.

Your Task: Design a data structure system that efficiently handles these tasks. Specifically, consider using a HashMap to store student information and an AVL Tree to store course information.

Questions:

    Data Structures Design: Describe how you would use a HashMap to store student information and an AVL Tree to store course information. What would be the key-value pairs in the HashMap, and how would you structure the AVL Tree?

    Enrollment Process: Explain the process of enrolling a student in a course using your data structure. How would you ensure that each student is uniquely identified, and how would you update the course roster accordingly?

    Registration Process: Describe how a student can add or drop courses during the registration period. How would you handle these operations efficiently?

    Generating Rosters: Given a course code, how would you use your data structure to generate a roster of enrolled students for that course?

    Student Schedules: How would you allow students to view their current schedules? Describe the data retrieval process for a specific student.

    Conflict Resolution: Explain how you would prevent students from enrolling in courses with overlapping schedules. What data or checks would you perform to ensure no schedule conflicts occur?

    Efficiency Considerations: Discuss the time complexity of key operations in your data structure (e.g., enrolling a student, generating a roster) and how you would optimize them for efficiency.

This case study question assesses your ability to design and implement data structures to solve real-world problems related to student enrollment and course registration efficiently.
